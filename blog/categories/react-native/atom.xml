    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>React Native has increased in popularity over the past year. It&rsquo;s growth will only sky rocket as more companies like AirBnB, Uber, Facebook, and even smaller agencies learn to leverage it.</p>

<p>One missing piece that I&rsquo;ve attempted to document for the past 2 years is animations. I started when I didn&rsquo;t know animations at all, and have grown to be able to breakdown and reconstruct them using the powers of Animated and React.</p>

<p>In my course we will walk through basic animations, understanding interpolation, and move onto real world examples like shared element photo grid transitions. I&rsquo;ve condensed all the knowledge I have about animations down into this course. Including animation breakdowns and explaining my mental model for how I build out UI before animating.</p>

<p>If you have learned anything from the free content I&rsquo;ve put out and want to support me, or are just getting started then come master React Native animations with my course.</p>

<p>You can purchase it at <a href="https://reactnativeanimations.com/">https://reactnativeanimations.com/</a>.</p>
