    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>React Native finally supports Websockets. Which is awesome, however there is one gotcha with socket.io.</p>

<p>1) <code>npm install socket.io-client</code>. This will just pull down the socket.io javascript client</p>

<p>2) Everything works great but there is one issue that <code>window.navigator.userAgent</code> doesn&rsquo;t exist. Socket.IO checks to deal with some browser incosistencies but we don&rsquo;t care. So all we have to do is create it. However make sure you require <code>react-native</code> first!</p>

<p>Just like so</p>

<p>```
var React = require(&lsquo;react-native&rsquo;);</p>

<p>window.navigator.userAgent = &ldquo;react-native&rdquo;;</p>

<p>var io = require(&lsquo;socket.io-client/socket.io&rsquo;);
```</p>

<p>Now you can do as you please with your new glorious websockets.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>WebSockets are wonderful, they are one of the cheapest ways to get realtime communications into your web app. They&rsquo;re also a great way to get realtime communications into your mobile application. AJAX is great but wasn&rsquo;t applicable to my needs. Developing PDXLiveBus app required the server to handle all requests to TriMets servers and use AJAX to request the state of particular buses/routes was less realtime than I wanted. I could go more in depth about my usage and experience but the main point of this post is to prevent some table flipping.</p>

<p>I had it all working in browser however it was not working when I did my phonegap serve. It just would not connect, nor even error out ( I don&rsquo;t think I waited long enough). I had been using <a href="https://github.com/mkuklis/phonegap-websocket">https://github.com/mkuklis/phonegap-websocket</a>, which Android WebView (what phonegap utilizes) doesn&rsquo;t support WebSockets until Android KitKat (4.4). I think this is a tremendous oversight, but I digress. I attempted various things to get <code>phonegap-websocket</code> to work but I just couldn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>The real problem wasn&rsquo;t with <code>phonegap-websocket</code> it was with my own server code. I had allowed CORS for the <code>restify</code> REST API I had setup but had forgotten to allow CORS for Socket.IO. It all came down to this single line of code.</p>

<p><code>
io.set( 'origins', '*:*' );
</code></p>

<p>Yeah not the most secure but then again I don&rsquo;t think I have a choice since everything is being served from phones and not a particular domain. Also I&rsquo;m dealing with public transportation vehicle location which doesn&rsquo;t necessarily needing extreme security.</p>

<p>So if you can&rsquo;t get Socket.IO to work on your Android Phonegap app, add <code>phonegap-websocket</code> and make sure you have allowed CORS on your server.</p>
